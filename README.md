# liturgical_calendar.py

Just a quick script I wrote to provide me with a liturgical calendar in the form of a markdown file. It focuses on these key dates:

- **The 9 principal feasts**: Christmas Day, Epiphany, Candlemas, Annunciation, Easter Sunday, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, and All Saints' Day
- **The 3 principal holy days**: Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday
- **Two lesser festivals**: The Baptism of Christ, and Christ the King
- **Other Notable Days**: Boxing Day, New Year's Day, St. Valentine's Day, Shrove Tuesday, Palm Sunday, Holy Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday/Saturday, and Harvest

I know there are an insane number of other notable days in the Christian liturgical calendar(s), but I need something simple to assist with the flow of the year for my young family so we can worship and pray together in simple but meaningful ways
